# explore

The **explore** objective is used to direct a player to go to a specific area for a quest. This objective is triggered whenever you change zones or subzones.

When you enter a zone or subzone in which you have an objective to explore certain coordinates, PMQ will begin polling on an interval to see if you're within the designated radius of those coordinates. PMQ will stop polling for your location when you leave the area of that objective or complete that objective.

### Shorthand

```yaml
objectives:
  - explore "zone*" "coords"
```

_*required_
