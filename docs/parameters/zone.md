# zone

<a href="../index.md"><sub>‚Üê Home</sub></a>

The **zone** and **subzone** parameters are used to specify the names of in-game areas where an objective must be completed.

### Value type

* String - the name of a zone or subzone as it appears in-game

### Supported objectives

| Objective | How it's used |
|---|---|
| [cast-spell](../objectives/cast-spell.md) | The zone where you must be when casting the spell |
| [equip-item](../objectives/equip-item.md) | The zone where you must be when equipping the item |
| [explore](../objectives/explore.md) | The zone where you must be in order to complete the objective |
| [gain-aura](../objectives/gain-aura.md) | The zone where you must gain the aura |
| [kill](../objectives/kill.md) | The zone where you must kill the target |
| [loot-item](../objectives/loot-item.md) | The zone where you must loot the item |
| [say](../objectives/say.md) | The zone you must be in when saying the message |
| [talk-to](../objectives/talk-to.md) | The zone where you must talk to the target |
| [use-emote](../objectives/use-emote.md) | The zone where you must use the emote |

This parameter can also be used as a [start or complete condition](../guides/start-complete.md).

### Usage notes

* Zone and subzone are completely interchangeable - both parameters will look at both your current zone and subzone for a match when evaluating objectives.
* The zone's name must be spelled and capitalized exactly as it is in-game in order for the objective to progress.
* Currently, there is no localization implemented in the addon, so players using a client in a different language (where the zone has a different name) will not be able to progress the objective. The initial release of PMQ is targeting English-language clients only, with localization to come later.
