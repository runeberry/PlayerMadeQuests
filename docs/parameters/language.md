The **language** parameter allows you to specify a Role-Playing language that a [message](../parameters/message.md) must be spoken in when completing an objective.

In order to speak in a special language other than Common (Alliance default) or Orcish (Horde default), you must left-click the chat bubble icon on your chat frame, go to Languages, and select the language you want to speak in. Your character must have proficiency in a language in order to speak it. In WoW: Classic, you can see your character's proficient languages under the Skills tab of the Character Info screen (default hotkey: K).

## Value type

* String - the name of the language as it appears in-game. See the [Language page on Wowpedia](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Language) for all available options.

## Supported objectives

| Objective | How it's used |
|---|---|
| [say](../objectives/say.md) | The language(s) that the message must be spoken in |

## Usage notes

* The language value is case-sensitive, meaning that it must matching the casing as it appears in-game. For example, "Dwarvish" will work, but "dwarvish" and "DWARVISH" will not work.
* You cannot whisper another player in a different language, so don't specify a language if the objective's [channel](../parameters/channel.md) is "whisper", or if you specify a message [recipient](../parameters/recipient.md).
* You can specify multiple languages, which means that sending the message in *any one* of these languages will satisfy the objective. For example:

```yaml
objectives:
  - say:
      message: "wash yer back"
      language: [ Dwarvish, Gnomish ] # You can say this in either Dwarvish or Gnomish
```
