# PlayerMadeQuests

**PlayerMadeQuests (PMQ)** is an addon for [World of Warcraft: Classic](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic) that allows you to write your own custom quests, play them in-game, and share them with other players.

Ready to try it out? You can get it here:

* Download PMQ from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pmq) (can be installed through the [CurseForge app](https://curseforge.overwolf.com/))
* Download the latest release in a zip file directly from [Github](https://github.com/runeberry/PlayerMadeQuests/releases)

Several playable demo quests are provided with PMQ to help you learn how to write your own quests. Additional help and even more examples can be found on this Wiki.

You can contribute to PMQ by giving us feedback during the Beta Test - join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/gHMjCgs)!
