# PlayerMadeQuests

**PlayerMadeQuests (PMQ)** is an addon for [World of Warcraft: Classic](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic) that allows you to write your own custom quests, play them in-game, and share them with other players.

Ready to try it out? You can get it here:

* Download PMQ from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pmq) (can be installed through the [CurseForge app](https://curseforge.overwolf.com/))
* Download the latest release in a zip file directly from [Github](https://github.com/runeberry/PlayerMadeQuests/releases)

Several playable demo quests are provided with PMQ to help you learn how to write your own quests. Additional help and even more examples can be found on this Wiki.
