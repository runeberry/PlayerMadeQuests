**PlayerMadeQuests (PMQ)** is an addon for [World of Warcraft: Classic](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic) that allows you to write your own custom quests, play them in-game, and share them with other players.

Ready to try it out? You can get it here:

Several playable demo quests are provided with PMQ to help you learn how to write your own quests. Additional help and even more examples can be found on this Wiki.
