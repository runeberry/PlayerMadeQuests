### Features

* Write out your own custom quest with just a few lines of YAML script
* **Demo Quests** - short quests provided with the addon to help you learn how to write your own
* **Real-time Objective Tracking** - plays just like a World of Warcraft quest
* **Quest Sharing** - share your quest with party members with the click of a button*

### Upcoming plans for PMQ

* **Quest Chains** - link multiple quests together to form a larger story
* **Localization** - share quests reliably between different-language game clients
